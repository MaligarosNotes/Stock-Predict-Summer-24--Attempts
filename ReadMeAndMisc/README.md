# Stock Predict Summer 24' Attempts
 
past attempts is a folder that has smaller attempts, whereas dedicated folders for an attempt are listed as such


do all the download things, like 


# install virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv .venv # for linux
> py -3 -m venv .venv   # for windows

# make sure you activate virtual environment
$ source .venv/bin/activate # for linux
> .venv\Scripts\activate # for windows

# install necessary dependencies 
$pip install -r ./ReadMeAndMisc/requirements.txt 
and what not
