Here's a list of tasks I want to do, that I haven't yet:

2. configure UserInput_Two to be able to test against actual stock data, because right 
now it is literally predicting 'future future' prices

3. Figure how to de-scale stock prices, esp important for multiple ticker's worth of data
    a) this entails a TON of scaling and de-scaling work, which must be built into the functions
    b) yea nah this is just REALLY fkn complex, jesus

4. this ones a complete conspiracy theory:
    a) stddev is a good gauge of IV of PAST DATA, but where's the future data then?
    b) black scholes model, very exciting shit, i think ill be able to play with that now

5. sorting the tons of tickers with fama french factors, i legit have NO IDEA how yet

Here's a list of task I completed:
1. Figure normal disto with the 'future future' predictor
